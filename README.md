# CSPAlgorithms
Implemented two Constraint Satisfaction Problem algorithms - Bactracking and Forward checking. Algorithms are generic.
There are two problems implemented - Einstein Riddle and Map Coloring problem.
To implement more problems you have to use interfaces defined in directory 'interfaces'.
